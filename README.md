## Description


I completed this project to implement skills acquired during the fifth week of EDX front-end development bootcamp. I was tasked with creating a fully functional password generator webapp meeting the following requirements:

<li>The app generates a password when the button is clicked.</li>
<li>It present a series of prompts for password criteria.</li>
<li>It generates a password that has at least 10, but no more than 64 characters.</li>
<li>It includes option to feature the following character types in the password: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters.</li>
<li>It validates for each input so that at least one character type should be selected.</li>
<li>Once prompts are answered, the password is generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.</li><br>


 The following screenshots presents the desired look of the deployed webapp:

Creating this portfolio page allowed me to:

 <li>Practice creating code in JavaScript.</li>
 <li>Widen my understanding of the following JavaScript features and characteristics: </li>

 - arrays<br>
 - functions<br>
 - methods<br>
 - if statements<br>
 - scope
 

<li>Practice debugging my code.</li>
<li>Practice GitHub workflow.</li><br>


## Installation
